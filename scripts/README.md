## Verification

After seeding, you can verify the data by:

1. **Via Browser Console:**
   ```javascript
   const { supabase } = await import('/src/integrations/supabase/client.ts');
   const { data } = await supabase.from('exhibitors').select('company_name, industry, package_type').order('booth_number');
   console.table(data);
   ```

2. **Via Directory Page:**
   - Visit `/directory` on your website
   - You should see all 20 exhibitors
   - Featured section should show 8 Premium exhibitors
   - Filters should work for different industries

## Troubleshooting

### If exhibitors don't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify the data was inserted: Run verification query above
3. Check that exhibitors have `status: 'approved'`
4. Clear browser cache and refresh

### If some inserts fail:
- Check for duplicate booth numbers
- Check for duplicate email addresses
- Verify all required fields are present

### To clear all exhibitors:
```javascript
const { supabase } = await import('/src/integrations/supabase/client.ts');
await supabase.from('exhibitors').delete().neq('id', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000');
console.log('âœ… All exhibitors deleted');
```

## Customization

To add more exhibitors or modify existing ones, edit the `exhibitors` array in `seed-exhibitors.js` or add more INSERT statements to `seed-exhibitors.sql`.

Each exhibitor object should have:
- `company_name` (required)
- `industry` (required)
- `status` (required - use 'approved' to show on site)
- `package_type` (Premium/Standard/Startup)
- `booth_number` (unique identifier)
- Other fields are optional but recommended
